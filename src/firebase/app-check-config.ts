 * This file contains the configuration for Firebase App Check, a security feature
 * that protects your backend resources from abuse.
 *
 * To complete the setup, you MUST replace the placeholder value below with your
 * actual reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
 *
 * How to get your reCAPTCHA v3 site key:
 * 1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
 * 2. Select your project.
 * 3. In the left-hand menu, go to Build > App Check.
 * 4. In the "Apps" tab, find your web app and click the three-dot menu, then "Manage reCAPTCHA keys".
 * 5. If you haven't registered a key yet, follow the instructions to register a reCAPTCHA v3 key.
 * 6. Copy the "Site key" provided.
 *
 * If you do not replace this placeholder, App Check will fail, and your users
 * will not be able to sign up or log in.
